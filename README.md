# Linux-Learning-Journey-Cybersecurity-Engineering
🐧 Introduction

As part of my cybersecurity engineering journey, I have been building strong foundational and intermediate skills in Linux system administration, security hardening, networking, and command-line operations.

Linux is the backbone of modern cybersecurity because most servers, cloud environments, and security tools run on Linux-based systems.

This document summarizes what I have learned, practiced, and implemented so far.

1️⃣ Understanding Linux Fundamentals
✔ What I Learned:

History of Linux and its development by Linus Torvalds

Linux kernel architecture

Role of the shell (Bash)

Differences between distributions

✔ Linux Distributions Explored:

Ubuntu (General purpose & server use)

Kali Linux (Security testing environment)

2️⃣ Linux File System & Navigation
✔ Directory Structure Mastered:

/

/home

/etc

/var

/bin

/usr

/root

✔ Commands Practiced:
pwd
ls
cd
tree

I can now navigate efficiently without relying on a graphical interface.

3️⃣ File & Directory Management
✔ Commands Practiced:
touch
cp
mv
rm
mkdir
rmdir
cat
less
nano
✔ Skills Gained:

Creating and managing files

Editing configuration files

Understanding file paths (absolute vs relative)

4️⃣ Linux Permissions & Ownership (Security Foundation)
✔ Concepts Learned:

Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x)

Octal permissions (755, 644, etc.)

User, Group, Others

✔ Commands Practiced:
chmod
chown
chgrp

I now understand how improper permissions can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

5️⃣ User & Group Management
✔ Commands Practiced:
useradd
usermod
userdel
passwd
groupadd
✔ Security Concepts:

Root vs normal users

Sudo privileges

Principle of Least Privilege

6️⃣ Process & System Monitoring
✔ Commands Used:
ps
top
htop
kill
killall
✔ Skills Developed:

Identifying running processes

Monitoring CPU and memory usage

Terminating suspicious processes

7️⃣ Networking in Linux

Networking is essential in cybersecurity.

✔ Commands Practiced:
ip a
ss -tuln
ping
traceroute
curl
wget
✔ Concepts Understood:

Open ports

Listening services

TCP/IP fundamentals

Network troubleshooting basics

8️⃣ Log Analysis & System Auditing
✔ Log Locations Explored:

/var/log/auth.log

/var/log/syslog

✔ Commands Used:
tail -f
grep
head
less
✔ Skills Gained:

Monitoring login attempts

Detecting authentication failures

Real-time log analysis

9️⃣ Package Management
✔ On Ubuntu:
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install
✔ Skills:

Installing security tools

Updating systems

Removing vulnerable software

🔟 Bash Scripting (Automation)
✔ Basic Script Example:
#!/bin/bash
echo "System Check Running"
✔ Concepts Learned:

Variables

Conditional statements

Loops

Script permissions

I am currently improving my automation skills for system monitoring tasks.

1️⃣1️⃣ Linux Security & Hardening
✔ Topics Covered:

SSH configuration

Disabling root login

File permission auditing

Basic firewall management (UFW)

Removing unnecessary services

✔ Commands Practiced:
systemctl status
ufw enable
1️⃣2️⃣ Tools Used in My Practice

VirtualBox

Kali Linux

Ubuntu

TryHackMe (Linux labs)

🧠 Key Competencies Developed

✔ Comfortable working fully in terminal
✔ Understand Linux file permissions deeply
✔ Can analyze logs
✔ Can monitor processes
✔ Basic server hardening knowledge
✔ Networking troubleshooting skills
✔ Beginner-to-intermediate Bash scripting

🚀 Ongoing Learning Goals

Advanced Bash scripting

Cron job automation

Advanced log auditing

Linux for cloud environments

Security monitoring and incident response

📌 Conclusion

Linux is now a core part of my cybersecurity engineering skillset. I am continuously improving my system administration, security hardening, and automation skills to become a well-rounded security engineer.

This journey is ongoing, and I will continue documenting advanced projects and labs.
